ofxiOSSoundPlayer is a light weight sound player for OpenFrameworks.

It is a wrapper for the native AVAudioPlayer class, which it uses to play sound.

It is an alternative to ofxOpenALSoundPlayer,
with the advantage of being able to play all supported sound formats on iOS.

It extends ofBaseSoundPlayer and implements all methods with the exception of the multi play features.
